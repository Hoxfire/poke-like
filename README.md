Game Description
  I got the idea to make this game after playing Pokémon Blue, that's why the temp name is poke-like. 
  So I've always been a fan of 1bit art and wanted to make a game with the style for a while, so I decided to do it with this. 
  However, the art style is a bit too limiting for actual gameplay in my opinion(really I don't have the skill or energy to try and make it work), 
  so I have the background a different palette from the player/interactables. 
  My idea for gameplay right now is Pokémon, but with wizard duels, but instead of creature collecting, your word collecting and piecing them together, kinda like Noita.
